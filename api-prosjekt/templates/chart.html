<h1>How does the chart work?</h1>

<p class="chartp1"> Sharktastic conducts research expeditions aboard the M/V SHARKTASTIC, which serves as an at-sea laboratory. 
    The M/V SHARKTASTIC contains a 75,000 lb. capacity hydraulic platform designed to safely lift marine animals 
    out of the ocean for access by a multi-disciplined research team.
</p>
</div>
<div class="chartp2">
<p>
    Animals are caught from tenders, using handlines, and are guided by hand in the water on and off the lift. 
    The animals are then brought to the submerged platform of the M/V SHARKTASTIC vessel and the platform is raised. 
    Once the animals are restrained and hoses of water have been set to enable a continuous flow of fresh seawater over 
    the gills, the science team, made up of researchers and veterinarians, begins its process. Tags such as SPOT, acoustic, 
    and accelerometer are attached, morphometrics are recorded, and samples, such as blood and tissue, are collected.
